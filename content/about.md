I'm a retired psychology professor but still active computer nerd. I love to use and dissect software, in particular open source software such as Blender, QGIS, ffmpeg, Exiftools and others.

These posts are my way of trying to stay on top of all that information and also a way of contributing to those lovely open source projects.

Look at these pages as a log book about exploring and discovering unknown territory. Magnificent views but also sometimes harsh environment. For example, like so many others, I wanted to give [Blender](/blender/) a try, a few years ago. So, I downloaded the program, opened it and then after a few hours closed it, not to reopen it for the next several months. It was not that I wasn’t thrilled: looking at a floating 3D-cube that I could actually move and rotate! How cool can it be? But then, came the reality check! May be I could ... (fill in some of your wishes) Oh? That doesn’t seem to work as expected! May I could …? Oh, oh, oh ...! There was so much to know, there were so many buttons, and sliders, and checkboxes and whatever strange terms that I’ve never heard of. Googling them made it worse: too simple, too macho, too old, too complex, too much. Blender has a steep learning curve. It’s easy to get discouraged.

Even now, after a few years of semi-intense use, I still run frequently into the old trap: “Oh, that doesn’t seem to hard; let’s do it with Blender”. And again, after many hours, I close the program with a few f-words.

And this history repeated itself for most other open source software tools such as Qgis, Portfolio Performance, FFMPEG, Exif Tool, ...

These posts will tell you the stories of these explorations into deep Open Source Software Space (OS³). From coming up with a brilliant idea (at least in my mind) to the successful result or miserable failure. It’s the story of trying, failing, understanding why and retrying. Of course, the part of understanding is the most important. It’s the only way to learn.

Happy readings!
