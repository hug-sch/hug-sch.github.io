I wanted to give Blender a try, a few years ago. So, I downloaded the program, opened it and then after a few hours closed it, not to reopen it for the next several months. It was not that I wasn’t thrilled: looking at a floating 3D-cube that I could actually move and rotate! How cool can it be? But then, came the reality check! May be I could … (fill in some of your wishes) Oh? That doesn’t seem to work as expected! May I could …? Oh, oh, oh …! There was so much to know, there were so many buttons, and sliders, and checkboxes and whatever strange terms that I’ve never heard of. Googling them made it worse: too simple, too macho, too old, too complex, too much. Blender has a steep learning curve. It’s easy to get discouraged.

Even now, after a few years of semi-intense use, I still run frequently into the old trap: “Oh, that doesn’t seem to hard; let’s do it with Blender”. And again, after many hours, I close the program with a few f-words.
